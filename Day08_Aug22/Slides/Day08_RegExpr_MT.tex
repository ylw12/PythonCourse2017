\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Overview
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Overview}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Regular expressions: what, why and how?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textcolor{myred}{Regular expressions} are useful to extract information from text.
	\item Set of ``rules'' to identify or match a particular sequence of characters.
	\item Most text in \textcolor{myaqua}{ASCII}: letters, digits, punctuation and symbols (but unicode can also be used)
	\item In Python, mainly through library \texttt{re}.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%% Matching characters
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Matching characters I}
\subsection{Simple}
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{The ABC's (and 123s) of regexpr}
\begin{itemize}
	\item ABC: just letters
	\item Numbers: the character ``$\backslash$d'' can be used in place of any digit from 0 to 9
	\item Wildcard: . [to actually look for a period, use``$\backslash$.'']
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \texttt{"cat.", "896.", "?=+.", "abc1"}
	\end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Matching characters II
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Include}
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Including characters}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The ``.'' sometimes is too powerful!
	\item Use brackets \textcolor{brick}{[]}. The instruction will only match \textcolor{redwine}{a single} character/letter inside the bracket and nothing else.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Match ONLY the first 3 words: \texttt{"can", "man", "fan", "dan", "ran", "pan"} \pause $\Rightarrow$ [cmf]an
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Matching characters II
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Exclude}
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Excluding characters}
\begin{itemize}
	\item To exclude chunks, use a hat ( $\hat{ }$ )
	\item \texttt{[\^{}abc]}: do not include if there's an a. b or c.
	\item Filter the first two words: \texttt{"hog", "dog", "bog"} \pause $\Rightarrow$ [\^{ }b]og
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Matching characters III
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Tricks I}
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Some tricks!}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Ranges: [0-6], [a-z]
		\item Lower vs. Upper: [a-zA-Z]
		\item Shortcut for characters in English: $\backslash$w $=$ [a-zA-Z0-9\_]
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Filter the first 3 words: \texttt{"Ana","Bob","Cpc", "aax", "bby", "ccz"} \pause $\Rightarrow$ [A-Z]$\backslash$w$\backslash$w
		\end{itemize}
		\item Repetitions: a\{3\} = match the character a 3 times, .\{2,6\} = between 2 and 6 of any character. 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Match ONLY the first two words: \texttt{wazzzzzzup, wazzup, wazup} $\Rightarrow$ waz\{2,\}up
		\end{itemize}
			\item \emph{Kleene} star represents either 0 or more or 1 or more of the character that it follows: $\backslash$d$*=$any number of digits, $\backslash$d+ = at least one digit.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Match the first three words: \texttt{"aaaabcc","aabbbbc", "aacc", "a"} \pause $\Rightarrow$ a\{2\}.$*$
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Matching characters IV
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Tricks II}
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{More tricks...}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Optionality: ab?c = match either ``ac'' or ''abc'' because ``b' is optional.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Match the first 3 words: \texttt{1 file found?, 2 files found?, 13 files found?, No files found.} \pause $\Rightarrow$ $\backslash$d+ files? found$\backslash$?
		\end{itemize}
		\item White space(s): $\backslash$r,$\backslash$n,$\backslash$t,`` '' $\rightarrow$ Use $\backslash$s!
		\item Whitespace characters are just like any other character and the special metacharacters like the star and the plus can be used as well.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Match the first 3 words from: \texttt{1. abc, 2.   abc, 3.      abc, 4.abc} \pause $\Rightarrow$ $\backslash$d$\backslash$.$\backslash$s+[a-z]\{3\}
		\end{itemize}
		\item $\backslash$S: any non-space character
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%% location
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Character location}
\subsection{Location I}
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Location in a word}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textcolor{myaqua}{Start}: $\hat{ }$
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Extract ``Mission'' but only from sentences that begin with that word $\Rightarrow$ $\hat{ }$Mission
		\end{itemize}
		\item \textcolor{myred}{End}: \$ , \texttt{word}\$
		\item Grouping: ()
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Extract the file name without the extension \texttt{file\_record\_transcript.pdf} \pause $\Rightarrow$ $\hat{ }$(file$\backslash$w+)
		\end{itemize}
		\item Nested groups: extract multiple layers of information.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Get the full date and year of \texttt{"Jan 1987", "MAy 1969", "Aug 2011"} \pause $\Rightarrow$ ($\backslash$w\{3\}$\backslash$s($\backslash$d+))
		\end{itemize}
		\item Conditionals: \texttt{I love (cats|dogs)}
		\item Metacharacters: $\backslash$d, $\backslash$w, $\backslash$s, $\backslash$D, $\backslash$W, $\backslash$S
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%% Application in Python
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Python RegExpr}
\subsection{Overview}
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Python implementation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Use \emph{raw} strings instead of regular Python strings. Raw strings begin with a special prefix (r) and signal Python not to interpret backslashes and special metacharacters in the string, allowing you to pass them through directly to the regular expression engine $\Rightarrow$ a pattern like ``$\backslash$n$\backslash$w'' will not be interpreted and can be written as r"$\backslash$n$\backslash$w" instead of "$\backslash\backslash$n$\backslash\backslash$w" as in other languages, which is much easier to read.
\end{itemize}
